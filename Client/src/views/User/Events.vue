              replicas of the Ark of the Covenant from churches to water bodies in a grand procession. The next morning,
              a symbolic baptism takes place, where worshippers renew their faith by being sprinkled with holy water.

          <div class="text-gray-500 mt-8 space-y-4">
            <p class="">
              The Meskel Celebration is one of Ethiopia‚Äôs most vibrant and historic religious festivals, commemorating
              the Finding of the True Cross on which Jesus was crucified. Observed on September 27 (or September 28 in
              leap years), this centuries-old tradition is marked by grand processions, prayers, and the lighting of the
              Demera bonfire.
            </p>
            <p class="">
              Meskel, meaning "cross" in Ge‚Äôez, traces its origins to Queen Helena of the Roman Empire, who, according
              to tradition, discovered the cross in the 4th century. Ethiopian Orthodox Christians believe that a vision
              guided her to its location, leading to the annual bonfire lighting as a symbol of faith and renewal.
            </p>
            <p class="">
              The main event takes place in Meskel Square, Addis Ababa, where thousands gather for the Demera ceremony.
              Priests dressed in colorful robes chant hymns, and a massive bonfire is lit, symbolizing Queen Helena‚Äôs
              revelation. The festival is also celebrated across Ethiopia with feasts, music, and dance.
            </p>
            <p class="">
              Recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, Meskel is more than a religious event‚Äîit‚Äôs a
              celebration of unity, faith, and tradition. Whether you're a visitor or a local, experiencing Meskel
              offers a glimpse into Ethiopia‚Äôs deep-rooted spiritual and cultural heritage.
